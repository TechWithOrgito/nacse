    <h2>New Blog #1 — Presenting NACSE</h2>

    <p>
      NACSE — the Newsletter of Applied Cybersecurity & Systems Engineering —
      was created to explore cybersecurity and systems engineering as they are
      practiced in real environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      The newsletter focuses on real systems, engineering decisions, and
      the security outcomes that emerge from architecture and operational context.
    </p>

    <p>
      NACSE serves as an accessible entry point for applied discussions that may
      later evolve into deeper work within JACSE.
